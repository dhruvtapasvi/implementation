# The structure of NORB

NORB contains images taken in different lighting conditions, zenith and azimuth angles etc.

## Factors of Variation:

Categories: 0 - 4  
Instances: 0 - 9  
Elevation: 0 - 8 (30 + 5 * e)  
Azimuth: 0 - 34, step 2 (10 * a)  
Lighting: 0 - 6  
Stereo Pair Index: 0 - 1 (L, R)  

## Vector Structure

Datapoint y in NORB labels Y has index i indicating:  
0: stereo  
1: category  
2: instance  
3: elevation  
4: azimuth  
5: lighting
